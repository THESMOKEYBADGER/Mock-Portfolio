<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Gabriel Robbertze and I am a Full Stack Web Developer!</p>

<p>Let me tell you a little bit about myself: </p>

<p>My interest in computers sparked when I was first given the opportunity to build one of my own, the task of putting something together that at first seemed complicated, but when broken down in to logical steps and executed properly produced a fully functional computer, spawned the bug that wouldn't stop biting.<br/>
  Thereafter I decided to pursue a degree in computer science, seeing as it was something that I took a great interest in and anticipated to be a leading field in the near future. <br/>
  I am tirelessly curious and passionate about learning and exploring concepts unfamiliar to me, broadening my scope of knowledge and understanding to implement newly formed skills. <br/> 
  Currently on my way to finishing my bachelors, I've simultaneously decided to delve into the world of web development, taking on second course with the aim to become a full stack developer. <br/>
  These prospects provide endless excitement, and I'm looking forward to see what I can learn next.</p>
